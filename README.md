# StickEmAll - Album Sticker Tracker App
StickEmAll is an iOS app developed in Swift that helps you keep track of your album sticker collections. With StickEmAll, you can effortlessly manage your sticker collection, generate QR codes for album exchanges, and simplify sticker trading with others, all without the need for an internet connection. The app works by generating a unique QR code based on the barcode of the album from which you want to exchange the stickers and your current collection of stickers. You can also easily track the stickers and statistics of the album.

## Features
